    <h1>Cape Cod</h1>

    <p>Cape Cod, which is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and forms a barrier for the rest of Massachusetts is vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  Wind and rain cause coastal erosion, wearing away the beaches and cliffs and depositing sediment elsewhere.  Increasing severity of storms has accerated this process.  This erosion and sea level rise have caused damage to homes and flooded roadways.  Climate change has also accelerated deterioration of the two bridges that provide the sole vehicle access to the Cape.</p>
    <p>Increasing sea levels will continue to cause more frequent flooding, endangering residents and infrastructure.  Rising sea levels can also allow salt water to infiltrate low lying freshwater marshes on the cape, destroying the habitats of many local birds and other wildlife.  The Cape is also expected to experience increasingly warmer temperatures, more droughts more frequent extreme weather.  </p>
    <p>Residents have built seawalls to protect property, which is effective but can negatively impact downstream beaches.  Groups have planted seagrass to stabilize dunes to slow erosion.  Some residents have elevated their homes to protect them against more frequent flooding.  </p><hr>

    <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html"> One can see from space how the human race has changed the Earth. Nearly all of the available land has been cleared of forest and is now used for agriculture or urban development. The polar icecaps are shrinking and the desert areas are increasing. At night, the Earth is no longer dark, but large areas are lit up. All of this is <em>evidence that human exploitation of the planet is reaching a critical limit</em>. But human demands and expectations are ever-increasing. We cannot continue to pollute the atmosphere, poison the ocean and exhaust the land. There isnâ€™t any more available.
