				<h2>All About Me</h2> 
				<p>I am originally from the midwestern part of the United States. I grew up on a farm in rural Ohio and went to college in Illinois at Northwestern University. Go Cats! I graduated from Northwestern with a BS/MS degree in Materials Science and Engineering.
				</p>
				<p>I left the midwest for the east coast in 1997 to attend graduate school at MIT. I again majored in Materials Science and Engineering. My research there focused on using focused electric fields to assemble micron-scale surface mount electronic components.
				</p>
				<p>When I finished graduate school, I worked first in the biomedical division at Draper, where I helped develop biotoxin detectors. I also got to work on developing an artificial liver and a variety of biosensors. I left Draper eventually to help start a small biotech company that was using a new battery technology to build a simple drug delivery pump. While I was there, I started teaching part time at Tufts University, where I got hooked on teaching.

					<h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
					<p>I hope to remain a classroom teacher for the rest of my career. I would eventually like to develop additional flexible curriculum that can be supplementary to the physical classroom. 
						I would like to implement enough supports to allow students to work at their own pace, so that the curriculum is flexible enough to meet all students' needs.  I hope to give
						students the skills to become independent learners so that they can continue to develop their knowledge beyond our classroom.
						I hope to incorporate more statistical analysis and/or bioinformatics and data science in our program.
